# BakingApp
Allows users to find interesting Recipies and watch step by step videos with instructions. Utilizes Exoplayer for media handling and fragments for customized layouts for phones and tablets.
Use
## Libraries
ButterKnife, Timber, ExoPlayer etc.
## Project Overview
In this Project I have included :
* Fragments to display the cooking recipes in different styles on both phone/tablet and potrait/landscape mode.
* Once the app runs, a widget would be added which on bringing it to main screen displays the ingredients of a random recipe. Clicking on which will display and play the respective recipe.
* Exoplayer to display videos of the cooking steps.
* I have used a couple of libraries in my app too.
